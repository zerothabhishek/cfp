This talk takes the audience through a query performance improvement tour. The case study here is a slow running reporting module that we try to optimize using ActiveRecord features. We talk about quite a few gotchas and surprises while at it and a some ways of measuring performance.

The talk is based on lessons from personal experience. Any Ruby developer who, like me, is not sufficiently proficient with Sql will relate to the story. And since it includes the details of measurement and various warnings and tips, it will be useful to any developer attempting a similar approach.
