The Ruby and Rails worlds have placed due emphasis on improving speed. While many of the improvements are happening on the language/framework side, database indexing is one bit that has to be left to developers. Indexing strategy is mostly so specific to the application, that even DBAs claim it is the application developer's job.

This talk makes an effort to share some low hanging fruits of indexing wisdom. The ideas in the talk can be treated like heuristics to get improved query performance out of the box, or as a starting point of getting better at query tuning.

I have studied the indexing and database performance with passion for the past few years. I have tried and tested the ideas in my own Rails projects. I have also shared these ideas as talks at local Ruby and Python meet-ups, and have discussed them with seasoned database experts. I'm reasonably confident about the interest it'll be able to generate on the subject.
