Database indexes are _the_ fundamental way of improving query performance. There are situations, however, when our defined indexes do not get used. 

Developer forums are full of discussions on how to ensure the query uses the intended indexes. (Here are Google results for 'mysql join index': http://i.imgur.com/Ds9eE0M.png)

This talk will go into the constraints that help decide if an index is used. These rules will help us plan our indexes better, and they give us some insights into database performance.
